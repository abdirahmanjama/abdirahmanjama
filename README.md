## Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

## I'll introduce myself via code!

```java
public class Engineer {
  private String name;
  private String occupation;
  private boolean needsCoffee;
  
  public Engineer(String name, String occupation, boolean needsCoffee){
    this.name = name;
    this.occupation = occupation;
    this.needsCoffee = needsCoffee;
  }
}

//this code instantiates a language agnostic software engineer who enjoys solving problems.

Engineer abdirahman = new Engineer("Abdirahman", "Software Engineer", true);
```
